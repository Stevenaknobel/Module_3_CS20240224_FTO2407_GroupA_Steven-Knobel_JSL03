Loom Recording Link: [https://www.loom.com/share/eda91ac88e05454696a2eba97a6c2527?sid=55673864-86d3-48d1-8666-6089649ae153]

# Project Overview

In this project, you will be presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. Your task is to analyse these examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style. 

You will present your reasoning for each example, record your presentation using Loom, and submit your findings along with the Loom recording to the Project Tab on the Learning Management System (LMS).

# Instructions

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Repo Link: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_3_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL03

1. Access the provided repository containing the starter code and presentation template.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor.

## Step 2: Analyze the Examples

1. In the cloned repository, you will find two JavaScript code examples labeled "Example 1" and "Example 2."
2. Examine each code example and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style.

## Step 3: Record Your Presentation

1. Use Loom (https://www.loom.com/).
2. Create a single video presentation for both examples that include the following:

   - Introduction of the example number.
   - Explanation of whether the example is imperative or declarative.
   - Detailed reasoning for your choice, discussing the code logic and style used in the example.
   - Mention any specific code structures or patterns that align with the chosen programming paradigm.
   
3. Keep each video presentation concise, with a maximum length of 2 minutes for each example. Your total recording time should not exceed 5 minutes.

## Step 4: Insert Loom Links

1. After recording, upload your presentation videos to Loom.
2. Obtain the Loom recording links for the video presentation.
3. Edit the `README.md` file in the cloned repository and insert the Loom recording links.
   
## Step 5: Submit Your Project
1. Commit your changes to the Git repository and push them to your GitHub account.
2. Ensure that the repository is public so that it can be accessed.
3. Submit the GitHub project link (URL) that includes your Loom recording link to the [JSL03] Project Tab on the LMS for evaluation.

# Project Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on your ability to:

- Accurately identify and differentiate between imperative and declarative programming styles.
- Provide clear and well-reasoned explanations for your choices.
- Present your findings concisely within the specified time limit.
- Follow the submission instructions accurately.

Follow the steps outlined above to complete the project successfully.

# Presentation Talking Points

Example #: [Insert Example Number]

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** Start by explaining the code logic in the imperative approach.
   - Mention each step of the process in the code.
   - Describe how the code provides explicit instructions for each action.
   - Discuss the use of variables to track the state and progress of the process.

2. **Emphasis on How:** Highlight how the imperative approach focuses on detailing "how" the task is accomplished.
   - Point out the use of loops, conditions, and explicit instructions.
   - Discuss any mutable variables or states that change during execution.


Example #: [Insert Example Number]

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **High-Level Process Description:** Explain the code logic in the declarative approach.
   - Describe the cooking process in a high-level, abstract manner.
   - Emphasize that the code defines "what" should happen rather than "how" it should happen.

2. **Use of Data Structures:** Discuss the use of data structures (e.g., arrays, objects) to represent the process steps.
   - Explain how the process steps are organized in a structured format.
   - Mention any abstraction layers or functions used to encapsulate actions.

# Learning Outcome [1 Minute]
- Reflect on what you've learned from analyzing these code examples in different paradigms.

presentation notes
hello and welcome to my presentation on imperative versus
 declarative programming

we will start by diving straight into example 1 which
demonstrates an imperative programming approach
cookSteak function, follows a detailed step-by-step process
	it first sets the grill temperature
	then seasons the steak, detailing both sides to be 
	seasoned
with then the main body of code being a while loop 
that continually cooks the steak until it reaches desired
	Doneness

this is clearly an imperative approach as the code explicitly
states HOW each task should be completed, by directly
manipulating each variable such as the steaktemperature 
and grilltemperature and controls the cooking process through
loops and conditionals.
the focus is on the how, detailing every step of the process
 which is the main characteric of imperative programming

now moving onto example 2 which demonstrates a declerative
programming approach

in this example the cooksteak function defines a high level
sequence of events to be performed
the cooking process is represented as an array of steps, 
each specifying an action and the related details such as
temperature/seasoning.
you then have the for loop executing these based off their
type

the declarative nature of this code is clear, as instead of 
focusing on the how it focuses on the what needs to be done
	preheat the grill
	season the steak
	cook til desired doneness
this approach abstracts away the internal mechanics of how
 each task is performed and focuses on a series
of high level steps to complete the cooking process


in conclusion, analysing these 2 examples highlights the
core differences between imperative and declarative 
programming

with example 1 having detailed step-by-step instructions, 
focusing on how each step must be completed and controlled
showcasing the imperative approach

in contrast to that example 2 focuses on declarative
 programming, where we abstract the process into high-level
actions focusing on what needs to be achieved rather than the
detailed exection of each individual task.

So just remember imperative is the how approach and declarative
is the what approach

I hope this presentation has been informative, Thank you for watching and have a lovely day!
